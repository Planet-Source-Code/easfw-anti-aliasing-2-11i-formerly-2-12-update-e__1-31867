### Description

Built from scratch, this program is the result of about 1000 hours worth of programming. It could be considered an effects generator. I think of it as a fine art tool.

After starting the program, tap the right arrow key a few times. This will give you an idea of what this program can do. The various controls change such things as individual RGB LFO rates, opacity, draw method, and background.

If you wish to experiment with settings yourself, as well as save a few that make you weak in the knees, check out the included text file.

I update this code often :o

Questions? Drop me an E!
